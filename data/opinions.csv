user1,Cooking,Published,Beginner cook needing dishes starting with R,|<p>A group of my buddies are doing a potluck where everybody brings a dish that starts with the first letter of their first name. I'm an okay cook, so I need something starting with R that's not super complicated. Needs to feed roughly 20 people or be something I can make multiples of. It doesn't matter if it's a main course or something small. Any suggestions?</p><p>Original post courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/zk5t7w/beginner_cook_needing_dishes_starting_with_r/" target="_blank">Reddit.com</a><br></p>|
user2,Cooking,Published,I can eat fish for the first time in life! What should I make/eat/buy?,|<p>I’ve suffered from a severe allergy to fish since childhood. If I ate any type of fish (excluding shellfish, I’ve been eating that my whole life) I’d go into anaphylactic shock. I was hospitalized several times for it as a kid and carried around an epipen for most of my adulthood preparing for the worst. Well, somehow, after 30+ years, I’ve grown out of it. I’ve been skin tested, blood tested, and as of last night have completed an eating test. I can now eat fish, any type. And I’m all in.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">My question to you all - what fish dishes should I eat? I’m pumped to try a fish filet from McDs, some sushi, battered catfish, fish sticks, and all the other things I’ve heard of and had to avoid like the plague. I’m making a list and will be checking things off one by one.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">No recipe is too daunting for me, no dish too wild, no restaurant too cheap - I’m here for all the flavors. Thank you in advance for helping me explore this tasty new chapter of my life!</span></p><p>Original post courtesy of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/zkhrz5/i_can_eat_fish_for_the_first_time_in_life_what/" target="_blank">Reddit.com</a><br></p>|
